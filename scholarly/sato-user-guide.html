            <p>
                This is a guide ment to help Users that want to use the SATO tool in order to start enriching their
                knowledge about IT, Technology and especially Web. Other target users of the application are technical
                or academic ones that want to be up to date with the Technology evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This guide will present the application screens that can be accessed by users and the activities that
                the users can do while in the application.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Information about software development is readily available on the web today, unfortunately it is mostly
                simply data, understandable by humans in the right context but very hard to aggregate and search by
                computers. SATO makes a step forward in this direction and comes up with a solution to unite big
                software development resources (such as GitHub, DevDocs, Reddit etc.) under one mashup API adding
                semantics to data by making it available in the RDF format.

            <h2>Application Screens</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>General Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The SATO service offers to its customers six screens that each has a different scope in the
                    application context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of the screens can be accessed from anywhere in the application via the application menu bar
                    which is perfect for switching from a context or activity to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below can be seen an image of the complete menu bar that can be used by a logged in user.
                    Take note of the username and the profile picture of the logged in user in the right side of the
                    menu bar.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    In the above image, the SATO Main Application Page can be seen. This page is the default page that
                    is displayed when first accessing the application but can also be accessed by
                    clicking the "Home" button in the Menu Bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page, SATO offers the users
                    the possibility of searching for resources in the SATO Knowledge Graph via the provided
                    Search Input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the Search Input, SATO offers by default to all users (logged in or not) some resource
                    suggestions that could be of interest to the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the above image, some notable suggested resources are related to Unison Web, an article related
                    to Google Chromebook, an articled about Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers,
                    an article related to CacheOut attacks, a blog related to building a BitTorrent client using Go
                    programming language and 3 other Github Repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On click over any of the suggestions, a new browser tab will be opened and the corresponding Web
                    resource will be opened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The suggestions are based in this case on the logged in user interests (editable from a screen that
                    will follow to be presented).

                <h3>Basic Search Page</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    A user can reach this page after first filling in the Search Input provided in the Main
                    Application Screen and pressing ENTER or clicking on the search button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this page, all search results that match the searched topic are available in a paginated
                    list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the above image, the first results for searching information about "Python" have title such as
                    "Python Vs Javascript Which Is Better For Your Future?", "C++ Vs Python: The Best Ever Comparison
                    Between OOPs" and "Bayesian Methods for Hackers".
                </p>
                <p>
                    On click over any of the result items, a new browser tab will be opened and the corresponding Web
                    resource will be opened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SATO offers to its users the possibility of making more advanced search from the "Advanced Search"
                    Screen.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>Advanced Search Page</h3>
                <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img src="./WADE/application-screens/advanced-search-page.png"

                <p>
                    Other than Basic Search, SATO offers a page that can be used for more advanced search.
                    A user can reach this page by clicking the "Advanced Search" button in the Menu Bar and its initial
                    appearance looks like in the above image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page provides additional filtering options such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search by pattern</li>
                    <li>Resource type (Article, News, Repository, Tutorial)</li>
                    <li>Topics of interest</li>
                    <li>Exclude not interesting topics</li>
                    <li>Programming Language</li>
                    <li>Platform (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows)</li>
                    <li>Date Range</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For resource types, topics, programming languages and platforms, the advanced search offers multiple
                    searchable multi-select components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those components are dropdown menus from which the user can search by pattern and choose multiple
                    options of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the fact that some concepts are represented in SATO ontology and in Wikipedia or Wikidata
                    as well, the multi-selects provide the full concept IRI to keep the clarity of the search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of how the multi-select components are behaving can be found in the image below.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    For a search that would be targeting all articles and news about android topic, that exclude any
                    android resource that would refer to C++ and React Native (remaining Java and Kotlin as
                    alternatives) the advanced search screen would look like in the image below:
                </p>
                <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                    <img src="./WADE/application-screens/advanced-search-page-android-example.png"

                </figure>
                <p>
                    After submitting the search and the results are collected, below the advanced search form a
                    paginated result list will be available for the users to interact with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On click over any of the result items, a new browser tab will be opened and the corresponding Web
                    resource will be opened.
                </p>
                <p>An example of such a search result can be seen in the image below:</p>

                For cases when users do not know what to search for and the suggestions provided on the Main Application
                Page are not enough, SATO application offers the Catalog Page where the users can see all categories of
                resources that SATO holds at the moment and can access them to see all the resources that correspond to
                each
                category.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above image, the current Catalog Page can be seen. This page can be accessed by clicking on the
                "Catalog" button in the Menu Bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                On click over any of the available catalog items, the full paginated list of resources that correspond
                to the clicked category will be opened.

            </figure>
            <p>
                The Resource List Page is the page that opens when clicking on any of the Catalog Page categories.
                In the above image the page that is opened after clicking on Web Articles category can be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the top left corner of the screen the resource category can be seen ("Articles") and the total number
                of resources in this category.
            </p>
            <p>
                A search by pattern input is provided to the user in order to have a way of filtering the content of the
                page. Bellow the search input, a paginated list of results is displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After adding a pattern and pressing ENTER or clicking on the search button, a search is triggered. After
                the search is finished the resource count in the top left corner of the screen and the paginated list
                content are updated. An example can be seen in the image below:
