            <p>
                This is a guide ment to help Users that want to use the SATO tool in order to start enriching their
                knowledge about IT, Technology and especially Web. Other target users of the application are technical
                or academic ones that want to be up to date with the Technology evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This guide will present the application screens that can be accessed by users and the activities that
                the users can do while in the application.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Information about software development is readily available on the web today, unfortunately it is mostly
                simply data, understandable by humans in the right context but very hard to aggregate and search by
                computers. SATO makes a step forward in this direction and comes up with a solution to unite big
                software development resources (such as GitHub, DevDocs, Reddit etc.) under one mashup API adding
                semantics to data by making it available in the RDF format.

            <h2>Application Screens</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>General Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The SATO service offers to its customers six screens that each has a different scope in the
                    application context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of the screens can be accessed from anywhere in the application via the application menu bar
                    which is perfect for switching from a context or activity to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below can be seen an image of the complete menu bar that can be used by a logged in user.
                    Take note of the username and the profile picture of the logged in user in the right side of the
                    menu bar.

                <p>
                    In the above image, the SATO Main Application Page can be seen. This page is the default page that
                    is displayed when first accessing the application but can also be accessed by
                    clicking the "Home" button in the Menu Bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this page, SATO offers the users
                    the possibility of searching for resources in the SATO Knowledge Graph via the provided
                    Search Input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the Search Input, SATO offers by default to all users (logged in or not) some resource
                    suggestions that could be of interest to the customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the above image, some notable suggested resources are related to Unison Web, an article related
                    to Google Chromebook, an articled about Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers,
                    an article related to CacheOut attacks, a blog related to building a BitTorrent client using Go
                    programming language and 3 other Github Repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On click over any of the suggestions, a new browser tab will be opened and the corresponding Web
                    resource will be opened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The suggestions are based in this case on the logged in user interests (editable from a screen that
                    will follow to be presented).
