## Welcome to SATO project 

## Description
Information about software development is readily available on the web today, unfortunately it is mostly simply data, _*understandable by humans in the right context but very hard to aggregate and search by computers*_. 

SATO makes a step forward in this direction and comes up with a solution to unite big software development resources (such as GitHub, MDN, DevDocs etc.) under one mashup API adding semantics to data by making them available in the RDF format.
